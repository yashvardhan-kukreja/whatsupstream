## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and a healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
* Being respectful and open to differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Taking accountability and offering apologies to those who have been impacted by our errors,
  while also gaining insights from the situation
* Focusing on what is best, not just for us as individuals, but for the
  community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

 ## Our Responsibilities
* Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
  expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

* Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
  issues and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
  contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
  This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project
  or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting
  via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
  The representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
  Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team.
  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
  The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
